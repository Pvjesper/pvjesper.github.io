abstract: Accurate sound field estimates are often cumbersome to obtain, since they
  generally rely on microphone measurements at several spatial positions within a
  room. In addition, room acoustics are often non-stationary, in which case the sound
  field has to be repeatedly re-estimated with new measurements. However, since the
  new and old measurements are recorded in different acoustic environments, it is
  not straightforward to fully exploit the combined measurements. In this paper, a
  Bayesian approach is taken where older measured data are considered to be more uncertain
  than newer data. The proposed method allows for the use of data captured in different
  acoustic environments. For each set of measurements, the position, directivity,
  and number of microphones are allowed to differ. It is demonstrated on real sound
  field measurements that the proposed approach is effective, being able to better
  account for different levels of uncertainty in the data
