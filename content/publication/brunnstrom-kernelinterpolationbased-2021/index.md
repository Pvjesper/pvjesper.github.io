abstract: Time-domain spatial active noise control (ANC) algorithms based on kernel
  interpolation of a sound field are proposed. Spatial ANC aims to suppress a primary
  noise field in a region by synthesizing an anti-noise field using secondary loudspeakers.
  In contrast to the multipoint pressure control by conventional ANC methods, it is
  necessary to estimate a sound field from microphone measurements at discrete positions.
  A promising approach is the kernel-interpolation-based spatial ANC method, which
  allows for flexible array configurations. However, most of the current methods are
  formulated only in the frequency domain, which cannot handle broadband noise with
  straightforward implementation. We formulate two time-domain spatial ANC algorithms
  based on kernel interpolation using a spatial interpolation filter defined by the
  kernel function. Numerical simulation results indicate that our filtered-x least-mean-square-based
  algorithms are effective for reducing nonstationary broadband noise in a region,
  as compared with multipoint pressure control.
