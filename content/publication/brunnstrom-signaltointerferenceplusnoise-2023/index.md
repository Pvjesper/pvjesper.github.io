abstract: Sound zone control is posed as an optimization problem where finite impulse
  response control filters are jointly optimized for low transmit power, while maintaining
  a sufficiently high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in all zones.
  This problem statement in particular allows the consideration of sound zone control
  under the additional influence of external noise, which is rarely taken into account
  and indeed necessitates an alternative problem statement. In addition, the spectral
  characteristics of the audio signals are taken into account, both for the transmit
  power minimization and computing the SINR. The optimization problem is shown to
  be solved optimally by semidefinite relaxation, but the computational cost is high.
  An alternate method is proposed, inspired by a duality between transmit and receive
  beamforming commonly exploited in digital communications. A virtual receive optimization
  problem for sound zone control is derived, and it is shown to have the same optimal
  solution as the original transmit optimization problem. The receive optimization
  problem is solved efficiently through a fixed point iteration algorithm. The two
  proposed methods are compared against acoustic contrast controlin a simulated reverberant
  environment, where it is shown that the proposed methods require less transmit power
  to produce similar SINRs.
