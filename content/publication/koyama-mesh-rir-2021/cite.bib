 abstract = {A new impulse response (IR) dataset called "MeshRIR" is introduced. Currently available datasets usually include IRs at an array of microphones from several source positions under various room conditions, which are basically designed for evaluating speech enhancement and distant speech recognition methods. On the other hand, methods of estimating or controlling spatial sound fields have been extensively investigated in recent years; however, the current IR datasets are not applicable to validating and comparing these methods because of the low spatial resolution of measurement points. MeshRIR consists of IRs measured at positions obtained by finely discretizing a spatial region. Two subdatasets are currently available: one consists of IRs in a three-dimensional cuboidal region from a single source, and the other consists of IRs in a two-dimensional square region from an array of 32 sources. Therefore, MeshRIR is suitable for evaluating sound field analysis and synthesis methods. This dataset is freely available at https://sh01k.github.io/MeshRIR/ with some codes of sample applications.},
