abstract: 'A new impulse response (IR) dataset called \"MeshRIR\" is introduced. Currently
  available datasets usually include IRs at an array of microphones from several source
  positions under various room conditions, which are basically designed for evaluating
  speech enhancement and distant speech recognition methods. On the other hand, methods
  of estimating or controlling spatial sound fields have been extensively investigated
  in recent years; however, the current IR datasets are not applicable to validating
  and comparing these methods because of the low spatial resolution of measurement
  points. MeshRIR consists of IRs measured at positions obtained by finely discretizing
  a spatial region. Two subdatasets are currently available: one consists of IRs in
  a three-dimensional cuboidal region from a single source, and the other consists
  of IRs in a two-dimensional square region from an array of 32 sources. Therefore,
  MeshRIR is suitable for evaluating sound field analysis and synthesis methods. This
  dataset is freely available at https://sh01k.github.io/MeshRIR/ with some codes
  of sample applications.'
