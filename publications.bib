  abstract = {Accurate sound field estimates are often cumbersome to obtain, since they generally rely on microphone measurements at several spatial positions within a room. In addition, room acoustics are often non-stationary, in which case the sound field has to be repeatedly re-estimated with new measurements. However, since the new and old measurements are recorded in different acoustic environments, it is not straightforward to fully exploit the combined measurements. In this paper, a Bayesian approach is taken where older measured data are considered to be more uncertain than newer data. The proposed method allows for the use of data captured in different acoustic environments. For each set of measurements, the position, directivity, and number of microphones are allowed to differ. It is demonstrated on real sound field measurements that the proposed approach is effective, being able to better account for different levels of uncertainty in the data},

  abstract = {Time-domain spatial active noise control (ANC) algorithms based on kernel interpolation of a sound field are proposed. Spatial ANC aims to suppress a primary noise field in a region by synthesizing an anti-noise field using secondary loudspeakers. In contrast to the multipoint pressure control by conventional ANC methods, it is necessary to estimate a sound field from microphone measurements at discrete positions. A promising approach is the kernel-interpolation-based spatial ANC method, which allows for flexible array configurations. However, most of the current methods are formulated only in the frequency domain, which cannot handle broadband noise with straightforward implementation. We formulate two time-domain spatial ANC algorithms based on kernel interpolation using a spatial interpolation filter defined by the kernel function. Numerical simulation results indicate that our filtered-x least-mean-square-based algorithms are effective for reducing nonstationary broadband noise in a region, as compared with multipoint pressure control.},

  abstract = {Sound zone control is posed as an optimization problem where finite impulse response control filters are jointly optimized for low transmit power, while maintaining a sufficiently high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in all zones. This problem statement in particular allows the consideration of sound zone control under the additional influence of external noise, which is rarely taken into account and indeed necessitates an alternative problem statement. In addition, the spectral characteristics of the audio signals are taken into account, both for the transmit power minimization and computing the SINR. The optimization problem is shown to be solved optimally by semidefinite relaxation, but the computational cost is high. An alternate method is proposed, inspired by a duality between transmit and receive beamforming commonly exploited in digital communications. A virtual receive optimization problem for sound zone control is derived, and it is shown to have the same optimal solution as the original transmit optimization problem. The receive optimization problem is solved efficiently through a fixed point iteration algorithm. The two proposed methods are compared against acoustic contrast controlin a simulated reverberant environment, where it is shown that the proposed methods require less transmit power to produce similar SINRs.},

Existing VAST methods optimizes the sound field at a set of discrete points, while the proposed method uses kernel interpolation to instead optimize the sound field over a continuous region. When the loudspeaker positions are known, the performance can be improved further by applying a directional weighting to the interpolation procedure. The proposed method is evaluated by simulating broadband sound in a reverberant environment, focusing on the case when microphone placement is restricted. The proposed method with directional weighting outperforms the pointwise VAST over the full bandwidth of the signal, and the proposed method without directional weighting outperforms the pointwise VAST at low frequencies.},

  abstract = {A new impulse response (IR) dataset called "MeshRIR" is introduced. Currently available datasets usually include IRs at an array of microphones from several source positions under various room conditions, which are basically designed for evaluating speech enhancement and distant speech recognition methods. On the other hand, methods of estimating or controlling spatial sound fields have been extensively investigated in recent years; however, the current IR datasets are not applicable to validating and comparing these methods because of the low spatial resolution of measurement points. MeshRIR consists of IRs measured at positions obtained by finely discretizing a spatial region. Two subdatasets are currently available: one consists of IRs in a three-dimensional cuboidal region from a single source, and the other consists of IRs in a two-dimensional square region from an array of 32 sources. Therefore, MeshRIR is suitable for evaluating sound field analysis and synthesis methods. This dataset is freely available at https://sh01k.github.io/MeshRIR/ with some codes of sample applications.},

  abstract = {An active noise control (ANC) method to reduce noise over a region in space based on kernel interpolation of sound field is proposed. Current methods of spatial ANC are largely based on spherical or circular harmonic expansion of the sound field, where the geometry of the error microphone array is restricted to a simple one such as a sphere or circle. We instead apply the kernel interpolation method, which allows for the estimation of a sound field in a continuous region with flexible array configurations. The interpolation scheme is used to derive adaptive filtering algorithms for minimizing the acoustic potential energy inside a target region. A practical time-domain algorithm is also developed together with its computationally efficient block-based equivalent. We conduct experiments to investigate the achievable level of noise reduction in a two-dimensional free space, as well as adaptive broadband noise control in a three-dimensional reverberant space. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method outperforms the multipoint-pressure-control-based method in terms of regional noise reduction.},
